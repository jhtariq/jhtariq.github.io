### Cloth State Estimation Using EKF 
This project focuses on estimating the state of deformable cloth using an **Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)**. Estimating the state of cloth is critical for robotic manipulation tasks involving fabrics, enabling precise control and interaction with deformable objects. The system combines a physics-based prediction model with real-time observations from AprilTags to achieve accurate state estimation.

---

### **Objectives**

- Develop a robust EKF-based framework for tracking the state of cloth.
- Integrate a physics prediction model (CIPC) for cloth dynamics.
- Utilize AprilTags for real-time observations to refine the state estimation.
- Minimize latency to meet real-time requirements.

### **Implementation Overview**

- **Observation Model**  
  - AprilTags are used to gather the real-time positions of markers attached to the cloth.
  - Observations are processed to correct the predicted state of the cloth.

- **Prediction Model**  
  - A physics-based model, CIPC (Compliant Implicit Physics Constraints), predicts the clothâ€™s state based on dynamics and applied forces.
  - EKF incorporates these predictions to maintain a probabilistic representation of the cloth's state.


### **Key Features**

- **Low Latency**: The EKF implementation achieves a processing latency of ~ 0.7 seconds, enabling real-time update  
- **Simulation to Reality**: Incorporates physical constraints to bridge the gap between simulation and real-world manipulation  
- **Scalable Framework**: Can be extended for applications beyond cloth manipulation, such as flexible or articulated objects  


### **Results**

- **Accuracy**: Demonstrated significant improvement in tracking precision compared to standard filtering techniques.  
- **Robustness**: The system performs reliably even with partial or noisy observations.
