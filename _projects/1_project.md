### Introduction
Quadruped robots face significant challenges in **dynamic obstacle avoidance and loco-manipulation** due to rapidly changing environments and this has been a prime research topic till now. To address this, we propose the implementation of a PRM planner that supports loco-manipulation tasks by planning in the *z-direction* as well. The proposed **kinodynamic** planner has been tested out in the simulation framework called QUAD-SDK.

### Motivation
The current implementation in the QUAD-SDK stack for the quadruped is the RRT-Connect algorithm that plans in *x* and *y* directions.

### PRM Implementation:
 
#### Key Features:
- PRM roadmap precomputed with nodes representing feasible configurations.
- Dynamic obstacle roadmap updates using environment feedback.
- Foothold selection and balance constraints incorporated.
- Adapted *z-axis* height for loco-manipulation tasks, ensuring stable trajectories.

### Results
Performance Metrics:
Path quality: Improved by ~30% compared to RRT-Connect.
Planning time: Reduced by ~20% under high obstacle density.
