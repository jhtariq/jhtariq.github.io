Hi! I'm Tariq, a second-year graduate student in the Mechanical Engineering Department at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and a member of the [Robotic Caregiving and Human Interaction Lab](https://rchi-lab.github.io/). <span style="color: red;">I am actively looking for full-time robotics roles in the domains of perception, planning and estimation so definitely reach out!</span>
<!-- Hi! I'm a second-year graduate student in the Mechanical Engineering - Research program at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), a [Belgian American Educational Foundation](https://baef.be/) Scholar, and a member of the [Robotic Exploration Lab](http://rexlab.ri.cmu.edu/). <span style="color: red;">I am actively looking for full-time roles in Aerospace (GNC), Robotics or any other interesting opportunities, so definitely reach out!</span> -->

Advised by Pr. [Zackory Ericson](https://zackory.com/), my current research focuses on real-time state estimation of cloth for applications in robotic manipulation tasks. This is first-of-its-kind work in coming up with a state estimation framework capable of detecting the state within the sub-1s window. I also actively worked on the prototype of an assistive knee brace for continuous monitoring of post knee surgery movements for application outside of clinical settings.

Summer 2024, I interned at [Oshkosh Corporation](https://www.oshkoshcorp.com/) as an Autonomy Intern where I developed and deployed a high-accuracy semantic segmentation model in a ROS 2 autonomy stack on NVIDIA Orin, enhancing AV navigation reliability and reduced HD map dependency. Previously during my undergrad, I interned with [Gamma Technologies](https://www.gtisoft.com/), where I explored and implemented diverse GT-Suite packages with a prime focus on Electric Vehicle Modeling, Thermal Management of Batteries and autonomy development models.

I graduated with a B.Tech in Mechanical Engineering from [NIT Trichy](https://www.nitt.edu/) (India) in 2023. My undergrad research was oriented towards prototyping MedTech solutions, implementing AI techniques like NLP, ML and Image Processing.
<!-- Previously, I graduated with a B.S. in Electromechanical Engineering from [UniversitÃ© libre de Bruxelles](https://www.ulb.be/en) (Belgium) in 2022. My undergraduate research was centered on the development, experimental testing, and control of new sensors and actuators for minimally invasive endoscopic and surgical tools, and on local model-order reduction optimization for spacecraft reentry simulation. -->

As a patrol-head since young, I am passionate about **advancing autonomous systems** across diverse environments, focusing on real-time trajectory optimization, motion planning, control, navigation, and integrating deep learning for enhanced performance and adaptability.

<!-- My interests encompass everything that moves: real-time trajectory optimization, motion planning, control, navigation, and leveraging deep learning for **high-performance autonomous systems**, on Earth and beyond.  -->
